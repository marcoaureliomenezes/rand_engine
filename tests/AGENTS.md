# Test Rules — <project-name>

> Installed by dadaia. Replace every `<ANGLE-BRACKET>` placeholder below with this project's own values before relying on it.
> A placeholder left in place means that section is not yet calibrated.

These rules override general workspace guidance for everything under `tests/`.
Agents creating or editing tests must follow them. Full protocol: skill
`dd-test-stewardship`.

- Intent, admission, deletion, tombstone: `dd-test-stewardship`; slop: `dd-code-review` SLOP.md and `specs/memory/QUALITY.md` fixed section.

## Architecture

- `tests/unit/**`: pure or near-pure tests only. No real subprocess execution,
  server threads, CLI runners, full workspace init, network, sleeps, or real git
  remotes. Process-boundary units may patch the runner; they must not spawn a
  process.
- `tests/contract/**`: public CLI/API/schema/security/projection/gate contracts.
- `tests/integration/**`: multi-component tests using tmp filesystem, service
  wiring, or CLI runner.
- `tests/e2e/**`: named end-to-end journeys only. Every file names an owner.
- `tests/tmp/**`: temporary debugging reproductions only; excluded from default
  collection and deleted or promoted before closure.

## Size tiers and cost

| Tier (marker) | Directory | Timeout default | Owner rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unit` | `tests/unit/**` | `<UNIT_TIMEOUT_S>` s | — |
| `contract` | `tests/contract/**` | `<CONTRACT_TIMEOUT_S>` s | — |
| `integration` | `tests/integration/**` | `<INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT_S>` s | — |
| `e2e` (LARGE) | `tests/e2e/**` | `<E2E_TIMEOUT_S>` s | every file names an owner |

A test that needs more time than its tier's default is **mis-tiered** — fix the
tier, never raise the default. The LARGE-tier census cap is `<LARGE_CAP>` per
module (abstract default in `dd-test-stewardship/PARAMETERS.md`'s "LARGE (E2E)
cap" row), reported as a warning until achievable.

`flaky` and `quarantine` markers are registered in `pyproject.toml`; a
`quarantine` marker without `bug="<bug-slug>"` refuses collection, and every
gating selector (CI jobs, release jobs, the pre-push preflight) excludes the
quarantine lane. Diagnosis runs use `-m quarantine` explicitly.

## Markers and cost

- Layer markers are applied automatically by directory via `tests/conftest.py`.
- Add `@pytest.mark.slow(reason="...")` to any test over 1 second or any test
  that starts a subprocess/server.
- The local loop is:

```bash
pytest -q -m "unit and not slow" tests/unit
```

Coverage is not the default loop. Use explicit coverage only for curated
unit/contract runs:

```bash
pytest -q -m "unit or contract" --cov=<PACKAGE> --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=<COVERAGE_FLOOR>
```
