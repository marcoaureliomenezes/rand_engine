# specs/backlog/ — Backlog Rules

Scope: this file governs only `specs/backlog/`.

- The backlog is the operator's demand queue: only the operator creates demand, `dd-product-engineer` curates `active[]`.
- An entry materializes only through the main thread's operator-facing intake report; an operator-ratified in-release deferral already counts as intake.
- Retention covers bugs and backlog only — a test is pruned by a `dd-code-reviewer` verdict.
- The backlog is a single JSON document: `specs/backlog/BACKLOG.json`, `{schema: "backlog-v1", active: [...]}`.
- No per-entry file per backlog item — every live candidate/idea is one `active[]` object.
- Full schema: `dd-backlog-definition` (The document), `schemas/backlog/backlog-v1.schema.json`.
- A closed item's history lives beside the document, in `specs/backlog/_archive/backlog_histo.jsonl`.

## 1. The document, plus its histo

- `active[]` (in `BACKLOG.json`) — one object per live candidate or idea, the document's only array.
- `backlog_histo.jsonl` (in `_archive/`) — one append-only record per closed item.
- Fields: `{id, ts, disposition, release, reason, summary, entry}`.
- One record per slug, ever — a duplicate exit is structurally impossible.

## 2. Authoring rules

- `BACKLOG_PY` below is `python3 .agents/skills/dd-backlog-definition/scripts/backlog.py` — this ledger's ONE writer.

- Create and append entries with `BACKLOG_PY new <slug>` — never hand-edit `BACKLOG.json`.
- `<slug>` matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$`.
- Every `active[]` entry carries five required fields: `title`, `opened` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `status`, `description`, `provenance`.
- `status` is `idea`, `candidate`, or another lowercase live (non-terminal) token.
- Plus one optional field: `intents` (see §4).
- An entry enters SDD when a release picks it: `python3 .agents/skills/dd-release-implementation/scripts/release.py new <id> --origin backlog:<slug>`.
- Never delete an entry — `BACKLOG_PY exit <slug> --disposition …` removes the `active[]` object and appends its one histo record.

## 3. Terminal disposition tokens

- An entry exits with one disposition of the vocabulary `BACKLOG_PY exit --help` lists: a delivery or supersession carries the release id in `release`, a rejection a one-line `reason`, a `to-bug` the id of its `BUGS.jsonl` record in `reason` — registration and exit share one `backlog` worktree.
- A postponed item stays in `active[]` with its status unchanged — it never exits.

## 4. Idea-stage freedom vs bound intents

- `idea` — an unbound brainstorm; no `intents` array required; doctor-clean with no further edits.
- `candidate` and beyond — the entry must carry a typed `intents[]` array; every subject must resolve to a canonical anchor.
- `BACKLOG_PY check` (`LEDGER-BACKLOG-SCHEMA`) refuses a malformed `intents[]`, an invalid `status` or an entry past `idea` with no `intents[]`.

```json
{"subject": {"kind": "code", "ref": "src/billing/models.py#Invoice"},
 "change": "what changes about this subject"}
```

### 4.1 The subject kinds

| kind | ref shape | derived from |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | `path/to/file[#word]`, any language | the repo's git paths; `#word` must occur in the file |
| `catalog` | a `catalog.json` feature slug | `specs/memory/product/catalog.json` |
| `doc` | a SPEC-DOC id or memory heading | `specs/memory/**/*.md` |
| `invariant` | an `INV-*` identifier | invariant declarations |

- Every ref is judged only by the doctor's `BL-SCHEMA`, which names the ref it cannot resolve.

## 5. Relationship to releases

- The pick is the SPEC's `**Origin:** backlog:<ids>` line; no status is written at pick time.
- `exit --disposition delivered --release <id>` is refused unless that SPEC's Origin names the slug.
- It exits once, at closure's disposition sweep, into `_archive/backlog_histo.jsonl`.
