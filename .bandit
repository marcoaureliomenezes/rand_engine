# Bandit Security Configuration for rand-engine
# https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html
#
# Context: This is a library for GENERATING MOCK/TEST DATA, not production data.
# Many "security" warnings are false positives in this context.

[bandit]
# Paths to exclude from scanning
exclude_dirs = [
    '/tests/',
    '/venv/',
    '/.venv/',
    '/build/',
    '/dist/',
    '/.tox/',
    '/__pycache__/'
]

# Test IDs to skip (comma-separated)
# 
# B101: assert_used
#   Reason: Asserts are used for internal invariants/preconditions.
#   Not a security issue for a data generation library.
#
# B311: random
#   Reason: Using random.* for generating test data, NOT cryptographic keys.
#   This is the PURPOSE of the library. secrets.* is overkill here.
#
# B324: hashlib without usedforsecurity
#   Reason: If we hash data, it's for deduplication, not security.
#
skips = B101,B311,B324

# Confidence level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
# Only report issues with at least MEDIUM confidence
# LOW confidence = too many false positives
confidence = MEDIUM

# Severity level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
# Report MEDIUM and HIGH severity issues only
severity = MEDIUM
